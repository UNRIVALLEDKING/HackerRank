# HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

# Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
# Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.
# Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:

# If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
# If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

# Function Description

# Complete the function gradingStudents in the editor below.

# gradingStudents has the following parameter(s):

# int grades[n]: the grades before rounding
