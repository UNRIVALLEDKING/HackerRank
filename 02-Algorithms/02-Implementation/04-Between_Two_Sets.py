# There will be two arrays of integers. Determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

# 1. The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
# 2. The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
# These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. Determine how many such numbers exist.


# Function Description

# Complete the getTotalX function in the editor below. It should return the number of integers that are betwen the sets.

# getTotalX has the following parameter(s):

# int a[n]: an array of integers
# int b[m]: an array of integers


# Returns

# int: the number of integers that are between the sets


# Sample Code

#!/bin/python3

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

#
# Complete the 'getTotalX' function below.
#
# The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
# The function accepts following parameters:
#  1. INTEGER_ARRAY a
#  2. INTEGER_ARRAY b
#


def getTotalX(a, b):
    # Write your code here
    result = 0
    for i in range(min(a), max(b)+1):
        isFactor = True
        for j in a:

                isFactor = False
                break
        if isFactor:
            for k in b:
                if k % i != 0:
                    isFactor = False
                    break
        if isFactor:
            result += 1
