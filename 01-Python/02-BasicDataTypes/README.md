## Lists

Python Lists are just like dynamically sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java). In simple language, a list is a collection of things, enclosed in [ ] and separated by commas.

```bash
fruits = ["apple", "mango", "strawberry"]
print(fruits)
```

## List Comprehension

List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

### Without List Comprehension

```bash
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
filterFruits = []

for i in fruits:
  if "a" in 1:
    filterFruits.append(i)

print(filterFruits)
```

### With List Comprehension

```bash
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]

filterFruits = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]

print(filterFruits)
```
